What we need to figure out before we can start programming
1) What stats every character will have (strength, dex, health, mana, etc.)
2) What actions every character can take (attack, guard, cast spell, flee, etc.)
3) How the stats of the characters will influence the chances of sucess of the attempted actions and when those actions will occur
